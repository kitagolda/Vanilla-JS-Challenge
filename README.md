Building 10 JS project:
•Time app
•Quiz app
•Recipe app
•Notes app
•ToDo app
•Movies app
•GitHub profiles
•Drawing app
•Password Generator
•Weather app

It's just my practice. Inspiration, challenge and tutorial was taken from Florin Pop's Chanel.

UPD. I'm definitely lost my time app during committing. But it was very easy.
